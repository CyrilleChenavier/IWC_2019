\begin{abstract}
  We study the confluence property for rewriting systems whose underlying set of terms admits a vector space structure. For that, we use deterministic reduction strategies.
  These strategies are based on the choice of standard reductions applied to basis elements.
  We provide a sufficient condition of confluence in terms of the kernel of the operator which computes standard normal forms.
  We present a local criterion which enables us to check the confluence property in this framework.
  We show how this criterion is related to the Diamond Lemma for terminating rewriting systems.

\section{\secUn}

The fact that local confluence together with termination implies
confluence has been known for abstract rewriting systems since
Newman's work~\cite{MR0007372}. For rewriting on noncommutative
polynomials, a similar result known as the Diamond lemma was
introduced by Bergman~\cite{MR506890} nearly 30 years later, in order
to compute normal forms in noncommutative algebras using rewriting
theory. It asserts that for terminating rewriting systems, the local
confluence property can be checked on monomials.

One difficulty of rewriting polynomials is that the naive notion of
rewriting path (obtained as the closure of the generating rewriting
relations under reflexivity, transitivity, sum and product by a
scalar) does not terminate. Instead, one needs to first consider
well-formed rewriting steps before forming the reflexive transitive
closure.

Nevertheless the Diamond lemma has proved to be very useful : together
with the works of Bokut~\cite{MR0506423}, it has given birth the
theory of noncommutative \G\ bases~\cite{MR1299371}. The latter have
provided applications to various areas of noncommutative algebra such
as the study of embedding problems (which appear in the works of Bokut
and Bergman), homological algebra~\cite{MR1072284, MR2110434} or
Koszul duality~\cite{MR1832913, MR0265437}.

Computation of normal forms in noncommutative algebra is also used to
provide formal solutions to partial differential equations. In this
framework, a confluence criterion analogous to the Diamond Lemma is
given by Janet bases~\cite{MR2394773}, which specify a deterministic
way to reduce each polynomial into normal form using standard
reductions~\cite{Mell}. The confluence criterion may then be asserted
as follows: for each monomial $m$ and each non-standard reduction
$m\to f$, $f$ is reducible into $\widehat{m}$, where the latter is
obtained from $m$ using only standard reductions.

In the presented paper, we propose an extension of the Diamond Lemma
which offers two improvements over the one from Bergman: first it
allows the treatment of non-terminating rewriting relations, and
second it does not presuppose a notion of well-formed rewriting
steps. This last property seems particularly promising in order to
extend the Diamond Lemma to other structures.

Instead of supposing that the rewriting relation studied is
terminating, we suppose given an ordering on the monomials,
independent of the rewriting relation.  We then use methods based on
standard reductions: for every monomial $m$, we select exactly one
reduction with left-hand side $m$, which is decreasing for the
ordering chosen. Such choices induce a deterministic way to reduce
each polynomial, obtained by applying simultaneously standard
reductions on every monomial appearing in its decomposition. When
these deterministic reductions terminate, one defines an operator
which maps every polynomial to its unique standard normal form.

From this operator, we define a suitable notion of confluence in
our setting, and show in Proposition~\ref{prop:h-conf_implies_conf}
that it implies the usual notion of confluence for the rewriting
system studied. We then provide an effective method for checking this
criterion in Theorem~\ref{thm:confluence_criterion}. This method is
based on a local analysis corresponding to checking local confluence
on monomials. In particular, when the rewriting system is terminating,
we show (Theorem~\ref{thm:diamond_lemma}) that we recover the Diamond
Lemma as a particular case of Theorem~\ref{thm:confluence_criterion}.

\section{\secDeux}\label{sec:deux}

\subsection{\secDeuxUn}\label{sec:deuxUn}

We fix a commutative field $\K$ as well as a well-founded partially ordered set
$(X,<_X)$. We denote by $\KX$ the vector space spanned by~$X$: an element
$v\in\KX$ is a finite formal linear combination of elements of $X$ with
coefficients in $\K$.  The sum of
$u=\sum\lambda_xx$ and $v=\sum\mu_xx$ equals $\sum(\lambda_x+\mu_x)x$ and
the product of $\lambda\in\K$ by $v$ equals $\sum(\lambda\lambda_x)x$.
For every $v\in\KX$, there exists a
unique finite set $\supp(v)\subset X$, called the \emph{support} of $v$,
such that
\begin{small}
  \begin{equation}\label{equ:support}
    v=\sum_{x\in\supp(v)}\lambda_xx\ \text{and}\ x\in\supp(v)\Rightarrow\lambda_x
    \neq 0.
  \end{equation}
\end{small}
\smallskip
\noindent
We
extend the order $<_X$ into the multiset order on $\KX$, denoted $<_{\KX}$:
for any $u,v \in \KX$, $u<_{\KX}v$ if $\supp(u) \neq \supp(v)$ and for any $x\in\supp(u)\setminus\supp(v)$, there
exists $y\in\supp(v)\setminus\supp(u)$ such that $y>_Xx$. Note that $<_{\KX}$ and $<_X$ coincide when restricted to $X$,
so we simply denote this order by $<$ in the rest of this paper.

\medskip

We fix a set $R\subseteq X\times\KX$ which represents rewrite rules of
the form $x\rewR r$. The set $R$ induces a rewriting relation on $\KX$ which reduces many $x$'s at once and defined as follows:
\begin{small}
  \begin{equation}\label{equ:rewriting_step}
    \sum_x\lambda_xx+v\rewR\sum_x\lambda_xr_x+v,
  \end{equation}
\end{small}
where $v$ is any element of $\KX$, and for any $x \in X$ appearing in the sum,  $\lambda_x\neq 0$, $x\rewR r_x\in R$ and $x\notin\supp(v)$.
Finally we denote by $\equivR$ the closure of $\rewR$ under transitivity, symmetry and sum.

\begin{definition}
  A \emph{local strategy} $h$ for $R$ is the choice, for every $x \in X$ not minimal for $<$, of a rewriting rule $h_x=x \rewR r_x$ such that $r_x < x$. 
\end{definition}

In the rest of this paper, we suppose chosen such a local strategy $h$ (note that such an $h$ may not exist). 
Any vector $v$ can be decomposed in a unique way as
$\sum\lambda_xx+v'$, where $y\in\supp(v')$ implies that $y$ is minimal
for $<$, and $x\in\supp(v)\setminus\supp(v')$ is not. We define a rewriting
relation $\rewh$ as follows:
\begin{small}
  \begin{equation}\label{equ:well-formed_rewriting_step}
    h_v = \sum\lambda_xx+v'\rewh\sum\lambda_xr_x+v',
  \end{equation}
\end{small}
where for every $x$, $h_x=x \rewR r_x$. Note in particular that if $x$ is minimal for $<$, then $h_x = x \to x$ is the identity on $x$.

\medskip

\begin{definition}
  A vector $v$ is said to be an \emph{$h$-normal form} if it is a normal
  form for $\rewh$.
\end{definition}


\begin{example}\label{ex:h_norma_form}
  Let $X=\{x,y,z,t\}$, $x\rewR y$, $y \rewR z + t$, $z \rewR y - t$. Note that this is not terminating since we have the infinite loop $y \rewR z + t \rewR (y - t) + t = y$. We choose the order $x > y > z,t$, and the following distinguished rewrite rules: $h_x = x \rewh y$ and $h_y = y \rewh z + t$. Then the $R$-normal forms are the $\lambda_t t$, while the $h$-normal forms are all the expressions of the form $\lambda_t t + \lambda_z z$.
\end{example}


\begin{lemma}\label{lem:h_normal_forms}
  Let $v$ be a vector in $\KX$. Either $v$ is minimal for $<$, or there exists $v'<v$ such that $v\rewh v'$. In particular, $h$-normal forms are
  precisely the minimal elements of $\KX$ for $<$. 
\end{lemma}

\medskip

For each $v\in\KX$ and strategy local strategy $h$, there exists at most one $v'$ such that $v \rewh v'$,
and $\rewh$ is compatible with the termination order $<$. As a
consequence, any $v \in \KX$ is sent by multiple applications of $\rewh$
to a unique $h$-normal form that we denote by $H(v)$. This defines a map
$H : \KX \to \KX$.  

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:linearity_of_H}
  The map $H$ is a linear projector, in the sense that for all $u,v \in \KX$ and $\lambda \in \K$, $H(u+v) = H(u) + H(v)$, $H(\lambda u) = \lambda H(u)$ and
  $H(H(u)) = H(u)$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  The $h$-normal forms are closed under sums, so that $H(H(v))=H(v)$ for
  every $v$, that is $H$ is a projector. Moreover, if $u \rewh u'$ and
  $v \rewh v'$, then we have $u + v \rewh u' + v'$. Iterating~$\rewh$, we
  get $H(u + v) = H (H(u)+H(v))=H(u)+H(v)$. 
\end{proof}

\subsection{\secDeuxDeux}\label{sec:deuxDeux}

In this section we investigate the confluence properties of $R$.
The main idea behind this section is that under suitable hypothesis $\rewh$ should form a terminating, confluent subrelation of $\rewR$.

We start in Definition \ref{def:standardisation_property} and the following propositions by relating the confluence of $\rewR$ to properties on $h$.
Then Theorem~\ref{thm:confluence_criterion}, we prove a confluence
criterion to check whether $R$ satisfies Definition~\ref{def:standardisation_property}.

\begin{definition}\label{def:standardisation_property}
  We say that $R$ is \emph{h-confluent} if for every rewrite rule $x\rewR v\in R$, we have $H(x-v) = 0$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
  Let us take the same example as in Example \ref{ex:h_norma_form}. We have three equations to check:
  \begin{small}
    \[
    H(x) = z + t = H(y),\qquad H(y) = z + t = H(z + t),\qquad H(z) = z = H(y - t),
    \]
  \end{small}
    and so $R$ is $h$-confluent. Replacing the rule $z \rewR y - t$ by $z \rewR y$, we get $H(z) = z$ and $H(y) = z + t$, so $R$ is not $h$-confluent anymore. 
\end{example}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:equationnal_theory}
  If $R$ is $h$-confluent, then
  $u \equivR v$ if and only if $H(u-v)=0$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
The relation $\equivR$ is the closure of $\rewR$ under transitivity, symmetry and sum. Since the relation $H(u - v) = 0$ is closed under these operations, we get one implication.

Reciprocally, if $H(u - v) = 0$ then by definition of $H$ we have $u \equivh v$, and in particular $u \equivR v$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:h-conf_implies_conf}
If $R$ is $h$-confluent then $\rewR$ is confluent.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Let $v,\ v_1,\ v_2\in\KX$ be such that $v\transR v_i$, for $i=1,\ 2$.
  From Proposition~\ref{prop:equationnal_theory}, $v_1-v_2$ belongs to
  $\ker(H)$, that is $H(v_1)=H(v_2)$. Denoting by $u$ the common value, we get
  $v_i\transR u$, which proves the proposition.
\end{proof}

Note that the previous proposition is a sufficient but not a necessary condition: taking $X$ to be the integers, with the relations $n \rewR n+1$ is confluent, but there exist no local strategy $h$ making $R$ $h$-confluent. 

We now introduce our criterion to show that $R$ is $h$-confluent. For that, we assume that the set of relations $R$ is equipped with a well-founded order $\prec$ satisfying the following decreasingness property:

\begin{definition}\label{proper:decreasingness_property}
  We say that $R$ is \emph{locally $h$-confluent} if for every
  $x \in X$ and $f=x\rewR v$, then letting $h_x=x\rewh r_x$, we
  have the confluence diagram:
  \begin{small}
    \[
    \xymatrix @C = 2.5em @R = 2.5em{
      x 
      \ar [r] ^{f}
      \ar[d] _{h_x}
      &
      v
      \ar@{<.>} [d] ^{*}
      \\
      r_x
      \ar@{<.>} [r] ^{*}
      & 
      v',
    }
    \]
  \end{small}
  where each rewriting step occurring in the dotted arrows is strictly
  smaller than $f$ with respect to  $\prec$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
  Continuing with Example \ref{ex:h_norma_form}, let us define an order $\prec$ on $R$ by the following ordering: $(x \rewR y), (y \rewR z + t) \prec (z \rewR y - t)$. This is guided by the heuristic that rules advancing towards an $h$-normal form should be favored over rules that do not: here $z$ is an $h$-normal form so the rule rewriting it is large for $\prec$. The following diagrams show that $R$ is locally $h$-confluent:
  \begin{small}
    \[
    \xymatrix @C = 2.5em @R = 2.5em{
      x \ar [r] _{R}  
      \ar [d] _{h_x}   
      & y 
      \ar@{=} [d]
      \\
      y
      \ar@{=} [r]
      & y
    }
    \qquad
    \xymatrix @C = 2.5em @R = 2.5em{
      y \ar [r] _{R}  
      \ar [d] _{h_y}   
      & z + t
      \ar@{=} [d]
      \\
      z + t
      \ar@{=} [r]
      & z + t
    }
    \qquad
    \xymatrix @C = 2.5em @R = 2.5em{
      z \ar [r] _{R}  
      \ar@{=} [d] _{h_z}   
      & y - t
      \ar [d] ^{R}
      \\
      z
      \ar@{=} [r]
      & z
    }
    \]
  \end{small}
\end{example}
\medskip

Our main result is the following.
\smallskip

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:confluence_criterion}
  If $R$ is locally $h$-confluent, then $R$ is $h$-confluent. In particular, $\rewR$ is confluent.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  We reason by induction on $r$ according to the order $\prec$. Looking at the square corresponding to $r$:
  \begin{small}
    \[
    \xymatrix @C = 2.5em @R = 2.5em{
      x 
      \ar [r] ^{r}
      \ar[d] _{h_x}
      &
      v
      \ar@{<.>} [d] ^{*}
      \\
      r_x
      \ar@{<.>} [r] ^{*}
      & 
      v',
    }
    \]
  \end{small}
 we have $H(x) = H(r_x)$ by definition of $H$, and $H(r_x) = H(v') = H(v)$ by induction hypothesis, which concludes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  Local $h$-confluence implies that the pair of rewriting relations $(\rewh,\rewR)$ is decreasing with respect to conversions (see \cite[Definition 3]{van2008confluence}), using the order $\prec$ on $R$ and the discrete ordering on $\rewh$. 
  By \cite[Theorem 3]{van2008confluence}, this implies that $(\rewh,\rewR)$ commute. Using the fact that $\rewh \subseteq \rewR$, one can then recover that $\rewR$ is confluent.
\end{remark}

\medskip


Let us show how the Diamond Lemma fits as a particular case of our setup.
\smallskip

\begin{theorem}[\cite{MR506890}]\label{thm:diamond_lemma}
  Assume that $\rewR$ is terminating and that for every $x\in X$, $x\rewR r$ and $x\rewR r'\in R$, $r$ and $r'$ are joinable. Then, $\rewR$ is confluent.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  We define an ordering $x > y$ on $X$ as the transitive closure of the relation ``there exists $v \in \KX$ such that $x \rewR v$ and $y\in\supp(v)$''. This is well-founded since by hypothesis $\rewR$ is terminating. By definition, if $x \in X$ is not minimal for $>$, then $x$ is not an $R$-normal form. Let us fix an arbitrary rewriting step $h_x= x \rewh r_x$.  By definition of~$>$, for any $y \in \supp(r_x)$ we have $y < x$ and so $r_x < x$, which shows that  $h$ is a local strategy. Ordering the rewrite rules by their left hand sides makes $R$ locally $h$-confluent. Theorem \ref{thm:confluence_criterion} finally shows that $R$ is confluent.  
\end{proof}

\section{\secTrois}\label{sec:trois}

\subsection{\secTroisUn}\label{sec:troisUn}

In this section, we introduce rewriting systems in rational Weyl algebras
and relate them to the framework introduced in Section~\ref{sec:deux}.
Before that, we first recall the definitions of Weyl algebras and of
monomial orders.
\medskip

We fix a set $X:=\{x_1,\cdots,x_n\}$ of indeterminates and we denote by
$Q(X):=\QXX$ the field of fractions of the polynomial algebra $\QX$ over
$\Q$. Let us introduce another set of variables
$\Delta:=\{\diff{1},\cdots,\diff{n}\}$. 

\begin{definition}
  The {\it rational Weyl algebra} over $\Q(X)$ is the set of polynomials
  over the inderminates $\Delta$ and coefficients in $\Q(X)$, subject to
  the following commutation rule:
  \[\diff{i}f=f\diff{i}+\frac{d}{dx_i}(f),\quad f\in\Q(X),\quad
  1\leq i\leq n,\]
  where $d/dx_i:\Q(X)\to\Q(X)$ is the partial derivative operator with
  respect to the indeterminate~$x_i$. This algebra is denoted by $\Weyl$.
\end{definition}

\todo{Lien avec EDP}

Given $\alpha=(\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_n)\in\N^n$, we denote by 
$\partial^{\alpha}:=\diff{1}^{\alpha_1}\cdots\diff{n}^{\alpha_n}$. Notice
that $\Weyl$ is a vector space on $\Q(X)$ and admits as a basis the set
$\left\{\partial^\alpha\mid\alpha\in\N^n\right\}$. Hence, elements of
$\Weyl$ should be thought as differential operators with rational
functions coefficients, and for this reason, a generic element of this
algebra is denoted by $\D$ and is called a differential operator. The
framework developed in Section~\ref{sec:deux} can be applied to rational
Weyl algebras by taking $\K:=\Q(X)$ and
$\basis:=\left\{\partial^\alpha\mid\alpha\in\N^n\right\}$. In particular,
the support of a differential operator $\D$ is the product of partial
derivative operators which occur in $\D$. It remains to introduce a
well-founded order on $\basis$, and for that, we consider monomial
orders.

\begin{definition}
  A {\em monomial order} $\preceq$ on $\basis$ is a well-founded total
  order that is compatible with multiplication of monomials, \ie,
  $\partial^{\alpha}\preceq\partial^{\beta}$ implies 
  $\partial^{\alpha+\gamma}\preceq\partial^{\beta+\gamma}$, for every
  $\alpha,\beta,\gamma\in\N^n$. For every differential operator
  $\D\in\Weyl$, let us denote by $\lm(\D)$ and $\lc(\D)$ the leading
  monomial and the leading coefficient of $\D$ with respect to $\preceq$,
  respectively, and let us write $r(\D):=\lc(\D)\lm(\D)-\D$. 
\end{definition}

Given an operator $\D\in\Weyl$, consider the rewriting relation on
$\Weyl$ defined as follows. Letting $\lm(\D)=\partial^{\alpha}$, we first
have the rewriting steps on monomials defined by
\begin{equation}\label{equ:rew_monomials}
  \forall\beta\in\N^n,\quad\partial^{\alpha+\beta}
  \to_{\D}\partial^{\beta}r(\D),\end{equation}
and then extend \eqref{equ:rew_monomials} by linearity. More generally,
for every set $\Theta=\{\D_1,\cdots,\D_r\}$ of differential operators, we
consider the rewriting system $(\Weyl,\rewTheta)$ defined by
$\D\rewTheta\D'$, whenever $\D\to_{\D_i}\D'$, for some $1\leq i\leq r$.

\todo{Il faudra remonter tout ça au cadre abstrait}

\subsection{\secTroisDeux}\label{sec:troisDeux}

In this section, we take $\K = \mathbb R(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)$ the field of real rational functions in $n$ variables, and look at the $\K$-algebra $A = \K[\partial_1,\ldots,\partial_n]$. We suppose given an ordering $\partial_n > \partial_{n-1} > \ldots > \partial_1$. By monomial, we mean unitary monomial.

\begin{example}
  Elements of $A$ should be thought of as systems of linear partial derivative equations. For example, the equation $x_1 \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1} - u = 0$ corresponds to the element $x_1 \partial_1 - 1$ in $A$.

  Similarly, the $1$-dimensional heat equation $\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \kappa \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}$  corresponds (taking $x_1 = t$ and $x_2 = x$) to the element $\partial_1 - \kappa \partial_2^2$.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
 For any monomial $m$ and $1 \leq k \leq n$ we denote by $\nu_k(m)$ the power of $\partial_k$ in $m$.
For any $\overline j =(j_1,\ldots,j_n) \in \mathbb N^n$, we denote by $\partial^{\overline j}$ the monomial $m$ such that $\nu_k(m) = j_k$ for all $k$. For any subset $E \subset \{1,\ldots,n\}$, we denote by $Mon(E)$ the set of monomials $m$ such that $\nu_k(m) = 0$ for all $k \notin E$. In particular, $Mon(\{1,\ldots,n\}$ is the set of all monomials of $A$ which we denote simply by $Mon$, while $Mon(\emptyset)$ is reduced to $\{1\}$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  A \emph{cone} is a pair $(m,E)$, where $m \in A$ and $E \subset \{1,\ldots,n\}$. $m$ is called the \emph{origin of the cone}, while $E$ is the \emph{direction}. A cone is \emph{monomial} if $m$ is a monomial. We denote by $(m,E)^*$ the family of monomials of the form $mp$, where $p \in Mon(E)$.

  If $S$ is a family of monomials, a \emph{cone-partition} of $S$ is a family of monomial cones $(m_i,E_i)$ for $i \in I$ such that for $i \neq j$, $(m_i,E_i)^* \cap (m_j,E_j) = \emptyset$ and $S = \coprod_{i \in I} (m_i,E_i)^*$. In other words the $(m_i,E_i)^*$ form a partition of $S$ into monomial cones. It is a finite cone-partition if $I$ is finite.
\end{definition}


 \begin{definition}
   A family of monomial cones $(m_i,E_i)$ with distinct origins is said to be \emph{complete} if it induces a cone-partition of the monomial ideal generated by the $m_i$s. 

   A family of cones $(p_i,E_i)$ is said to be \emph{complete} if $(lm(p_i),E_i)$ is complete. 
 \end{definition}

 \begin{lemma}
  A complete family of cones gives rise to a local strategy on $A$. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}[\todo{Sketch}]
  We use the monomial ordering on reducible monomials, and reducible ones are bigger than irreducible ones.

  Then we only need to define $h$ on reducible ones. For $x \in Red(R)$, there exists a unique $(m_i,E_i)$ in the cone-partition such that $x=m_i p$ with $p \in E_i$ and $m_i$ corresponds to an element $m_i + r$ of $R$. Then $h$ is defined by $h_x = x = m_ip  \rewR -rp$.
\end{proof}


In order to produce suitable cone-partitions as in the previous lemma, we introduce the notion of multiplicative variables.

\begin{definition}
  Let $M$ be a subset of $Mon$, and let $m  \in M$. We define a subset $\mu_M(m)$ of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$. Let us write $m = \partial_1^{i_1}\partial_2^{i_2}\ldots \partial_n^{i_n}$, and take $k \in \{1,\ldots,n\}$. Then $k \in \mu_M(m)$ if the following implication is true:
  \[
\forall m' \in M, \quad (\forall j < k, \nu_j(m') = \nu_j(m) \, \quad \Rightarrow \quad \, \nu_k(m') \leq \nu_k(m)).
  \]
  

  We call $(m,\mu_M(m))$ the cone of $m$ in $M$. If $M$ is clear then we will just write $\mu(m)$. If $k \in \mu(m)$ we will say that $\partial_k$ is a \emph{multiplicative variable} of $m$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:multiplicative_cones_disjoint}
Let $M \subset Mon$ and $m,m' \in M$. If $m \neq m'$, then $(m,\mu(m))^* \cap (m',\mu(m'))^* = \emptyset$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
   Since $m \neq m'$, there exists $k$ minimal such that $\nu_k(m) \neq \nu_k(m')$. Without loss of generality, we can suppose $\nu_k(m) < \nu_k(m')$. By definition of $\mu$, we therefore have that $k \notin \mu(m)$.

   Take now $p \in (m,\mu(m))^* \cap (m',\mu(m'))^*$. Then $p = mq$, with $\nu_k(q) = 0$, and so $\nu_k(p) = \nu_k(m)$. But $p$ is a multiple of $m'$ and so $\nu_k(m) = \nu_k(p) \geq \nu_k(m')$, which is contradictory.
 \end{proof}

 \begin{definition}
   A set of monomials $M$ is \emph{Janet-complete} if the family of all $(m,\mu(m))$ is complete.

   A set of polynomials $R$ is \emph{Janet-complete} if $lm(R)$ is Janet-complete.
\end{definition}




\paragraph{Conclusion.} We introduced a sufficient condition, based on deterministic reduction strategies, of confluence for rewriting systems on vector spaces. As a particular case, we recover the Diamond Lemma. This work maybe extended in particular into two main directions. The first one consists in weakening our assumption on the set $\K$ of coefficients, by allowing non invertible coefficients. A second extension consists in characterising Janet bases in this framework, with the objective to develop constructive methods in the analysis and formal resolution of PDE's.
