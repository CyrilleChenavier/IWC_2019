\begin{abstract}  
  We study the confluence property for rewriting systems whose underlying set of
  terms admits a vector space structure. For that, we use deterministic
  reduction strategies. These strategies are based on the choice of standard
  reductions applied to basis elements.

  We provide a sufficient condition of confluence in terms of the kernel of the
  operator which computes standard normal forms. We present a local criterion to
  check the confluence property in this framework, and show that this criterion
  is related to the Diamond Lemma for terminating rewriting systems.

  Finally, we relate these strategies to the notion of involutive division on
  rational Weyl algebras, and completely characterise the strategies induced by
  an involutive division.

\section{Introduction}

So-called ``abstract rewriting'' was founded by Newman~\cite{MR0007372}, who
proved that terminating and locally confluent rewriting systems are
confluent. On the other hand, ``algebraic rewriting'' stems from the work of
Bergman~\cite{MR506890}, which proved the Diamond Lemma to compute normal forms
in noncommutative algebras. It asserts that for terminating rewriting systems,
the local confluence property can be checked on monomials.

Abstract rewriting is a very active field of research in computer science,
especially through its instanciations as graph rewriting or (higher order) term
rewriting systems. Most recently, higher dimensional rewriting systems have been
used to compute cofibrant replacements for monoids or PROs. \todo{references}

Algebraic rewriting has also proved to be very useful: together with the
works of Bokut~\cite{MR0506423}, it has given birth the theory of noncommutative
\G\ bases~\cite{MR1299371}. The latter have provided applications to various
areas of noncommutative algebra such as the study of embedding problems (which
appear in the works of Bokut and Bergman), homological algebra~\cite{MR1072284,
  MR2110434} or Koszul duality~\cite{MR1832913, MR0265437}.

These two theories have nevertheless been developed largely independently,
although similar results sometimes appear in both frameworks. The main obstacle
to unifying these two theories appears to be that the naive notion of rewriting
path in algebraic rewriting (obtained as the closure of the generating rewriting
relations under reflexivity, transitivity, sum and product by a scalar) does not
terminate in the sense of abstract rewriting. Instead, one needs to first
consider well-formed rewriting steps before forming the reflexive transitive
closure.

The goal of this paper is therefore to develop a theory of algebraic rewriting
which does not presuppose a notion of well-formed rewriting steps, as a
first step towards a unification of these two theories.

Our formalism is based on the notion of rewriting strategy. We prove in this
setting a slightly more general version of Bergman's Diamond Lemma: it allows
the treatment of non-terminating rewriting relations.

Instead, we suppose given an ordering on the monomials, independent of the
rewriting relation.  We then use methods based on standard reductions: for every
monomial $m$, we select exactly one reduction with left-hand side $m$, which is
decreasing for the ordering chosen. Such choices induce a deterministic way to
reduce each polynomial, obtained by applying simultaneously standard reductions
on every monomial appearing in its decomposition. When these deterministic
reductions terminate, one defines an operator which maps every polynomial to its
unique standard normal form.

From this operator, we define a suitable notion of confluence in our setting,
and show in Proposition~\ref{prop:h-conf_implies_conf} that it implies the usual
notion of confluence for the rewriting system studied. We then provide an
effective method for checking this criterion in
Theorem~\ref{thm:confluence_criterion}. This method is based on a local analysis
corresponding to checking local confluence on monomials. In particular, when the
rewriting system is terminating, we show (Theorem~\ref{thm:diamond_lemma}) that
we recover the Diamond Lemma as a particular case of
Theorem~\ref{thm:confluence_criterion}.




Computation of normal forms in noncommutative algebra is also used to provide
formal solutions to partial differential equations. In this framework, a
confluence criterion analogous to the Diamond Lemma is given by auto-reduced
involutive divisions, which specify a deterministic way to reduce each
polynomial into normal form using standard reductions~\cite{Mell}. In the second
part of this paper, we relate auto-reduced involutive divisions to our notion of
rewriting strategies. In particular we show that any such division induces a
rewriting strategy, and completely characterise the rewriting strategies which
arise in this way. We also show that the \emph{passivity} of an involutive
division corresponds to the (local) confluence of the associated strategy. \todo{ref partout}

\section{A weak version of the Diamond Lemma}
\label{sec:a_weak_version_of_the_Diamond_Lemma}

Throughout this section, we fix a ground field $\K$, a $\K$-vector space
$V$, and a basis $\basis$ of $V$. We say vectors and basis elements for
elements of $V$ and $\basis$, respectively. Every vector $v$ admits a
unique finite decomposition with respect to the basis $\basis$ and
coefficients in the ground field:

\begin{equation}\label{equ:vector_decompo}
  v=\sum\lambda_ie_i,\quad\lambda_i\neq 0.
\end{equation}
The set of basis elements which appear in the decomposition
\eqref{equ:vector_decompo} is called the {\it support} of $v$ and is
written $\supp(v)$.
\medskip

We also fix a subset $R$ of $\basis\times V$, whose elements are called
rewriting rules. A rewriting rule is denoted by $e\rewR r$, where $e$ 
and~$r$ are the images of this rule through the natural projections of
$R$ on $\basis$ and $V$, respectively. Throughout the paper, we use the
standard terminology of rewriting theory, see~\cite{MR1629216}.

\subsection{Strategies on linear rewriting systems}
\label{sec:strategies_on_linear_rewriting_systems}

In this section, we present our general framework for rewriting systems
on vector spaces and introduce the notion of strategies for such systems.
These strategies are used to introduce a criterion in 
Section~\ref{sec:confluence_relative_to_a_strategy}.
\medskip

We first extend the rewriting rules into a rewriting relation on $V$ by
considering elementary reductions that reduce many basis elements at
once. Formally, elementary reductions are of the following form: 

\begin{equation}\label{equ:rewriting_step}
  \sum_{i=1}^n\lambda_ie_i+v\to\sum_{i=1}^n\lambda_ir_i+v,
  \smallskip
\end{equation}
where $n$ is a strictly positive integer, $v$ is a vector, and for each
index $i$ in the sum, $\lambda_i$ is a nonzero scalar, $e_i\rewR r_i$ is
a rewriting rule, and $e_i$ does not belong to $\supp(v)$. Notice that we
do not assume that $\supp(v)$ contains only basis elements that are
irreducible for $\rewR$. This rewriting relation is still denoted by
$\rewR$ and its closures under transitivity, reflexivity and sum (resp.
and symmetry) is denoted by $\transR$ (resp. $\equivR$). Finally, a
normal form for $\rewR$ is called an $R$-normal form. In the sequel, we
refer $\rewR$ as the rewriting relation induced by the rewriting rules
$R$.
\medskip

Let $S$ be a subset of $R$ whose elements are denoted by~$e\rewS r_e$
\footnote{The double head on the arrow are here to mark the difference
  between elements of $S$ and rewriting rules.}. We extend $\rewS$ into
the rewriting relation, still denoted by~$\rewS$, defined such as
in~\eqref{equ:rewriting_step}, with the additional property that there is
no $e\rewS r_e$ in the strategy such that $e\in\supp(v)$. In other words,
a vector $u$ admits a unique decomposition
\[u=\sum_{i=1}^n\lambda_ie_i+v,
\smallskip\]
where each $\lambda_i$ is nonzero, each $e_i$ is a left-hand side of $S$,
each basis element in $\supp(v)$ is not, and if $n$ is nonzero and
$e_i\rewS r_i$ are elements of the strategy, then we have 
\[u\rewS\sum_{i=1}^n\lambda_ir_i+v.
\smallskip\]
The closure of $\rewS$ under transitivity and symmetry is denoted by
$\transS$. A normal form for $\rewS$ is called an $S$-normal form. Notice
that $u\transS v$ implies $u\transR v$ and that the two rewriting
relations $\rewRR$ and $\rewR$ are different as soon as $R$ contains two
elements with distinct left-hand sides.
\smallskip

\begin{definition}
  A {\em pre-strategy} is a subset $S$ of $R$ such that its left-hand
  sides are pairwise distinct. A pre-strategy is called a {\em strategy}
  if the rewriting relation $\rewS$ is terminating. 
\end{definition}
\smallskip

In order to illustrate our notions, we consider the following running
example.
\smallskip

\begin{example}\label{ex:h_norma_form}
  Let $\basis:=\{a,b,c,d\}$ and consider the set $R$ of rewriting rules
  defined as follows:
  \[a\rewR b,\quad b\rewR c+d,\quad c\rewR b-d.
  \smallskip\]
  Note that $\rewR$ is not terminating since there is a rewriting loop
  due to $b\rewR c+d$ and $c+d\rewR (b-d)+d=b$. We select the
  pre-strategy $S$ defined as follows:
  \[a\rewS b,\quad b\rewS c+d.
  \smallskip\]
  This pre-strategy is clearly a strategy since every vector admits an
  $S$-normal form after one reduction by $\rewS$. The $R$-normal forms
  are the elements of the form $\lambda_dd$, while the $S$-normal forms
  are all the expressions of the form $\lambda_dd+\lambda_cc$.
\end{example}
\smallskip

We finish this section by introducing the normalisation operator of a
strategy $S$. By definition of a strategy, for every $v\in V$, there
exists at most one $v'$ such that $v\rewS v'$. Moreover, since~$\rewS$ is
terminating, $v$ is sent by multiple applications of~$\rewS$ to a unique
$S$-normal form, written $\SNF(v)$. This defines a map $\SNF:V\to V$ that
we use to introduce our confluence criterion in
Section~\ref{sec:confluence_relative_to_a_strategy}.
\medskip

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:linearity_of_H}
  The map $\SNF$ is a linear projector.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  The $S$-normal forms are closed under sum, so that
  $\SNF(\SNF(v))=\SNF(v)$ for every vector $v$, so that $\SNF$ is a
  projector. Moreover, if $u\rewS u'$ and $v\rewS v'$, then by definition
  of~$\rewS$, we have $u+v\rewS u'+v'$. Iterating~$\rewS$, we get
  \[\SNF(u+v)=\SNF(\SNF(u)+\SNF(v))=\SNF(u)+\SNF(v),
  \smallskip\]
  which proves linearity of $\SNF$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Confluence relative to a strategy}
\label{sec:confluence_relative_to_a_strategy}

In this section, we introduce $S$-confluence and show that this property
implies confluence of~$\rewR$. We also show that $S$-confluence is
characterised in terms of a decreasingness property. We finish by a new
proof of the Diamond Lemma, based on $S$-confluence.
\smallskip

\begin{definition}\label{def:standardisation_property}
  Given a strategy $S$ for $R$, we say that $\rewR$ is \emph{S-confluent}
  if for every rewriting rule~$e\rewR r$, we have $\SNF(e-r)=0$.
\end{definition}
\smallskip

In the following theorem, we show that under $S$-confluence hypothesis,
$\rewR$ is confluent and the equivalence relation $\equivR$ that it
induces is entirely characterised by $S$-normal forms. 
\medskip

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:S-confluence_criterion}
  Let $R$ be a set of rewriting rules and let $S$ be a strategy for $R$.
  If $\rewR$ is $S$-confluent, then we have $u\equivR v$ if and only if
  $\SNF(u-v)=0$. Moreover, $\rewR$ is confluent.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  We show the first assertion. The relation $\equivR$ is the closure of
  $\rewR$ under transitivity, symmetry and sum. Since the relation
  $\SNF(u-v)=0$ is closed under these operations and contains $\rewR$ by
  $S$-confluence, we get one implication. Reciprocally, if $\SNF(u-v)=0$,
  then we have $\SNF(u)=\SNF(v)$, and by definition of $\SNF$, we get
  $u\transS\SNF(u)$ and $v\transS\SNF(v)$. Finally, $v_1\transS v_2$
  implies $v_1\transR v_2$ and we get $u\equivR v$.

  For the second assertion, let us consider three vectors
  $v,v_1,v_2\in V$ such that for $i=1,2$, we have $v\transR v_i$. By the
  first part of the proposition, we have $\SNF(v_1)=\SNF(v_2)$. Since we
  have $v_i\transS\SNF(v_i)$, we get $v_i\transR\SNF(v_i)$, so that
  $\rewR$ is confluent.
\end{proof}
\smallskip

Note that $S$-confluence is a sufficient but not a necessary condition
for confluence. Indeed, with $\basis$ the set of integers and the
rewriting rules $n\rewR n+1$, there is no strategy such that~$\rewR$ is
confluent relative to this strategy.
\smallskip

\begin{example}\label{ex:S-conf}
  Let us continue Example~\ref{ex:h_norma_form}. The following identities
  hold:
  \[\SNF(a)=c+d=\SNF(b),\qquad\SNF(b)=c+d=\SNF(c+d),\qquad
  \SNF(c)=c=\SNF(b-d),
  \smallskip\]
  so that $\rewR$ is $S$-confluent, and hence confluent. Notice that if
  we replace the rule $c\rewR b-d$ by $c\rewR b$, we get $\SNF(c)=c$ and
  $\SNF(b)=c+d$, so $\rewR$ is not $S$-confluent anymore. 
\end{example}
\smallskip

In Proposition~\ref{prop:S-conf_decreasing}, we show that $S$-confluence
is caracterised in terms of the decreasingness property that we introduce
in Definition~\ref{def:decreasing}. In order to state this definition, we
introduce the following notation: for every basis element $e$, we write
$e\overset{=}{\twoheadrightarrow}_Sr_e$, for $e\rewS r_e$ if such a
rewriting rule exists in the strategy $S$ and $e=r_e$, otherwise.
\smallskip

\begin{definition}\label{def:decreasing}
  Given a strategy $S$ for $R$ and a well-founded order $<$ on $R$,
  we say that $R$ is {\em decreasing} w.r.t.\ $(S,<)$ if for every
  rewriting rule $e\rewR r$, we have a diagram:
  \[\begin{tikzcd}
      e\ar[d, "_R"']\ar[r, twoheadrightarrow, "=", "_S"'] &
      r_e\ar[d, leftrightarrow, dotted, "*"', "_R"]\\
      r\ar[r, leftrightarrow, dotted, "*", "_R"'] & v
    \end{tikzcd}\]
  where each rewriting rule occurring in the dotted arrows is strictly
  smaller than the rewriting rule $e\rewR r$ relative to $<$.
\end{definition}
\smallskip

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:S-conf_decreasing}
  Let $S$ be a strategy for $R$. The following assertions are equivalent.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $R$ is $S$-confluent.
  \item There exists a well-founded order $<$ on $R$ such that $R$ is
    decreasing w.r.t.\ $(S,<)$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  $(1)\Rightarrow (2)$: We define the order $<$ on $R$ by
  $e\rewS r_e<e'\rewR r$ whenever $e'\rewR r\notin S$. This order is
  clearly well-founded since each chain of strictly decreasing elements
  has length $2$. Let $e\rewR r$ be a rewriting rule and let us construct
  a decreasing diagram as in Definition~\ref{def:decreasing}. We
  distinguish three cases.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item If $e$ is an $S$-normal form, then we have $\SNF(e)=e$ and
    $e\rewR r$ does not belong to~$S$. Moreover, since $\rewR$ is
    $S$-confluent, we have $\SNF(e)=\SNF(r)$, so that we get the
    following diagram
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
    e\ar[d, "_R"']\ar[r, equal] &
    e\ar[d, equal]\\
    r\ar[r, twoheadrightarrow, "*", "_S"'] & e
    \end{tikzcd}\]
    Since $r\transS e$ implies $r\transR e$ and since $e\rewR r$ is greater
    than all elements of $S$ by definition of $\prec$, this diagram is
    decreasing w.r.t.\ $(S,<)$.
  \item If $e\rewR r=e\rewS r$ belongs to $S$, then we have the following
    diagram:
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
    e\ar[r, twoheadrightarrow, "_S"']\ar[d, "_R"']
    & r \ar[equal, d]\\
    r\ar[r, equal] & r
    \end{tikzcd}\]
    Since no rewriting step occurs in the right and bottom faces, this
    diagram is decreasing w.r.t.\ $(S,<)$.
  \item In the last case, $e$ is not a $S$-normal form and $e\rewR r$
    does not belong to $S$. In particular, there exists a rewriting rule
    of the form $e\rewS r_e$ in the strategy $S$. Moreover, by
    definitions of the map $\SNF$ and of the $S$-confluence property, we
    have the equalities
    \[\SNF(r_e)=\SNF(e)=\SNF(r).
    \smallskip\]
    Hence, we get the following diagram:
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
    e\ar[r, "_R"']\ar[d, twoheadrightarrow, "_S"'] &
    r \ar[twoheadrightarrow, , "_S", "*"', d] \\
    r_e\ar[r, twoheadrightarrow, "_S"', "*"] & \SNF (e)
    \end{tikzcd}\]
    Since $e\rewR r$ does not belong to $S$ and since every rewriting
    step in the right and bottom faces belong to $S$, they are smaller
    than $e\rewR r$ for $<$ by definition of this order. Hence, the
    diagram is decreasing w.r.t.\ $(S,<)$.
  \end{itemize}
  $(2)\Rightarrow (1)$: Let $e\rewR r$ be a rewriting rule and let us
  assume by induction that for every rewriting step $e'\rewR r'$ smaller
  than $e\rewR r$ for $<$, we have $\SNF(e')=\SNF(r')$. Consider a
  decreasing diagram:
  \[\begin{tikzcd}
  e\ar[d, "_R"']\ar[r, twoheadrightarrow, "=", "_S"'] &
  r_e\ar[d, leftrightarrow, dotted, "*"', "_R"]\\
  r\ar[r, leftrightarrow, dotted, "*", "_R"'] & v
  \end{tikzcd}\]
  Using our induction hypothesis and adapting the argument in the first
  part of the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:S-confluence_criterion}, we have
  $\SNF(r)=\SNF(v)=\SNF(r_e)$. Hence, since $\SNF(e)=\SNF(r_e)$ by
  definition of the map $\SNF$, we have $\SNF(e)=\SNF(r)$. The order
  $<$ being well-founded, this inductive argument proves that
  $\SNF(e)=\SNF(r)$ for every rewriting rule $e\rewR r$, that is $R$ is
  $S$-confluent.
\end{proof}
\smallskip

\begin{remark}
  Based on Proposition~\ref{prop:S-conf_decreasing}, local $S$-confluence
  implies that the pair of rewriting relations $(\rewS,\rewR)$ is
  decreasing with respect to conversions
  (see~\cite[Definition 3]{van2008confluence}), using the order $<$ on
  $R$ and the discrete order on $\rewS$. 
  By~\cite[Theorem 3]{van2008confluence}, this implies that
  $(\rewS,\rewR)$ commutes. Using the fact that $\rewS \subseteq \rewR$,
  one can then recover that $\rewR$ is confluent.
\end{remark}
\smallskip

\begin{example}\label{ex:end_to_example}
  Let us illustrate Proposition~\ref{prop:S-conf_decreasing} with
  Example~\ref{ex:S-conf}. Let us consider the following order $<$ on
  rewriting rules:
  \[(a\rewR b)<(c\rewR b-d),\quad(b\rewR c+d)<(c\rewR b-d).
  \smallskip\]
  This choice is guided by the heuristic that rules advancing towards an
  $S$-normal form should be favored over rules that do not: here $c$ is
  an $S$-normal form, so the rule that rewrites it should be larger for
  the order $<$. The decreasing diagrams are the following:
  \[\begin{tikzcd}
  a\ar[d, "_R"']\ar[r, twoheadrightarrow, "_S"'] &
  b\ar[d, equal] & b\ar[d, "_R"']
  \ar[r, twoheadrightarrow, "_S"'] & c+d\ar[d, equal] &
  c\ar[d, "_R"']\ar[r, twoheadrightarrow, "_S"'] & c\ar[d,equal]\\
  b\ar[r, equal] & b & c+d\ar[r, equal] & c+d & b-d\ar[r,  "_R"'] & c
  \end{tikzcd}\]
\end{example}
\smallskip

We finish this section by showing how the Diamond Lemma fits as a
particular case of our setup.
\medskip

\begin{theorem}[\cite{MR506890}]\label{thm:diamond_lemma}
  Let $R$ be a set of rewriting rules such that $\rewR$ is terminating
  and for every $e\in\basis$ such that $e\rewR r$ and $e\rewR r'$, $r$
  and $r'$ are joinable. Then,~$\rewR$ is confluent.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  For every basis element $e$ that is reducible by $\rewR$, we select
  exactly one arbitrary rewriting rule $e\rewR r_e$ with left hand-side
  $e$. Then, let $S$ be the pre-strategy composed of these selected
  rewriting rules. Since $\rewR$ is terminating and contains $\rewS$, the
  latter is also terminating, so that $S$ is a strategy for $R$. Let us
  show that $\rewR$ is $S$-confluent using the criterion of
  Proposition~\ref{prop:S-conf_decreasing}. For that, we define the order
  $<$ on $R$ by letting $(e\rewR r)<(e'\rewR r')$ whenever there exists a
  vector $v$ such that $e'\transR v$ and $e'\in\supp(v)$. This order is
  well-founded since $\rewR$ is terminating. Now, let $e\rewR r$ be a
  rewriting rule, so that $e$ is not an $R$-normal form and
  $e\overset{=}{\rewS}r_e$ means $e\rewS r_e$. Using the confluence
  hypothesis of the theorem, we have a diagram
  \[\begin{tikzcd}
  e\ar[d, "_R"']\ar[r, twoheadrightarrow, "_S"'] &
  r_e\ar[d, rightarrow, "*"', "_R"]\\
  r\ar[r, rightarrow, "*", "_R"'] & v
  \end{tikzcd}\]
  Each rewriting rule appearing in the right and bottom faces is strictly
  smaller than $e\rewR r$ for~$<$ by definition of this order. Hence,
  this diagram is decreasing, so that $R$ is $S$-confluent. From 
  Theorem~\ref{thm:S-confluence_criterion}, $\rewR$ is confluent.   
\end{proof}
\smallskip

Notice that in the proof of the Diamond Lemma, we select for $<$ another
order than the one given in the proof of
Proposition~\ref{prop:S-conf_decreasing} (the latter asserts that each
rule of $S$ is smaller than each rule which is not in $S$ and there is no
other comparison). That illustrates that even if $S$-confluence seems to
be a strict notion at a first sight, it is flexible in the sense that
allowing to reverse rewriting rules does not bring more confluence
diagrams as soon as these rules are small enough for at least one
well-founded order. 

\section{Differential elimination in rational Weyl algebras}
\label{sec:differential_elimination_in_rational_Weyl_algebras}

Throughout the section, we fix a set $X=\{x_1,\cdots,x_n\}$ of
indeterminates and we denote by $\Q(X):=\QXX$ the field of fractions of
the polynomial algebra $\QX$ over $\Q$. We fix another set of variables
$\Delta=\{\diff{1},\cdots,\diff{n}\}$ that model partial derivative
operators, see Example~\ref{ex:diff_operators_init}. We denote by
$\partial^{\alpha}:=\diff{1}^{\alpha_1}\cdots\diff{n}^{\alpha_n}$ the
monomial over $\Delta$ with multi-exponent
$\alpha=(\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_n)\in\N^n$. Finally, let $\monBasis$ be
the set of monomials over $\Delta$:
\[\monBasis:=\left\{\partial^\alpha:\ \alpha\in\N^n\right\}.
\smallskip\]
In what follows, we keep the terminology monomials only for elements of
$\Mon(\Delta)$ and not for elements in $\Mon(X)$.

\subsection{Rewriting systems on rational Weyl algebras}
\label{sec:rewriting_systems_on_Weyl_algebras}

In this section, we recall the definition of the rational Weyl algebra
and introduce rewriting systems on the rational Weyl algebra induced by
monic operators.
\medskip

\begin{definition}
  The {\it rational Weyl algebra} over $\Q(X)$ is the set of polynomials
  $\Q(X)[\Delta]$ with coefficients in $\QXX$ and indeterminates
  $\Delta$. The multiplication of this algebra is induced by the
  commutation laws $\partial_i\partial_j=\partial_j\partial_i$ and
  \[\diff{i}f=f\diff{i}+\frac{d}{dx_i}(f),\quad f\in\Q(X),\quad
  1\leq i\leq n,
  \smallskip\]
  where $d/dx_i:\Q(X)\to\Q(X)$ is the partial derivative operator with
  respect to~$x_i$. This algebra is denoted by $\Weyl{n}$.
\end{definition}
\smallskip

Notice that $\Weyl{n}$ is a $\QXX$-vector space and that the monomial set
$\monBasis$ is a basis of~$\Weyl{n}$. Elements of~$\Weyl{n}$ should be
thought as differential operators with rational functions coefficients
and for this reason, a generic element of this algebra is denoted by $\D$
and is called a differential operator. In the following example, we
illustrate how these operators provide an algebraic model of linear
systems of ordinary differential (in the case $n=1$) and partial
derivative equations (in the case $n\geq 2$). 
\smallskip

\begin{example}\label{ex:diff_operators_init}
  {\color{white}toto}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item\label{it:ODE_init} The linear ordinary differential equation
    $y'(x)=xy(x)$ is written in the form $(\D y)(x)=0$, where the operator
    $\D:=\partial-x$ belongs to $\Weyl{1}=\Q(x)[\partial]$. 
  \item\label{it:Janet_example_init} Consider the Janet
    example~\cite{MR3532888}, that is the linear system of partial
    derivative equations with~$3$ variables, one unknown function, and
    the two equations $y_{33}(x)=x_2y_{11}(x)$ and $y_{22}(x)=0$, where
    $y_{ij}(x)$ denotes the second order derivative of the unknown
    function $y(x)$ with respect to the variables $x_i$ and~$x_j$. Then,
    these equations are written $(\D_1y)(x)=0$ and $(\D_2y)(x)=0$, where
    $\D_1,\D_2\in\Weyl{3}$ are defined as follows:
    \[\D_1:=\partial_3^2-x_2\partial_1^2,\quad \D_2:=\partial_2^2.
    \smallskip\]
  \end{enumerate}
\end{example}

\begin{remark}
  In~\ref{it:ODE_init} of Example~\ref{ex:diff_operators_init}, we
  implicitly used that every $f\in\QXX$ induces a unique multiplication
  operator $y(x)\mapsto f(x)y(x)$.
\end{remark}
\smallskip

The next step before introducing rewriting systems on rationanl Weyl
algebras is to recall the definition of monic operators. We fix a
monomial order $\prec$ on $\monBasis$, that is a well-founded total order
which is admissible, \ie, $\partial^{\alpha}\prec\partial^{\beta}$
implies $\partial^{\alpha+\gamma}\prec\partial^{\beta+\gamma}$, for every
$\alpha,\beta,\gamma\in\N^n$. Given an operator $\D$, we denote by
$\lm(\D)$ the leading monomial of $\D$ with respect to~$\prec$, that 
is~$\lm(\D)$ is the greatest element of $\supp(\D)$, where the support is
defined w.r.t.\ the basis $\monBasis$. 
\smallskip

\begin{definition}
  Let $\prec$ be a monomial order on $\monBasis$. A differential
  operator $\D\in\Weyl{n}$ is said to be $\prec$-{\em monic} if the
  coefficient of $\lm(\D)$ on $\D$ is equal to $1$. Moreover, given a
  monic differential operator $\D$, we denote by $r(\D):=\lm(\D)-\D$.
\end{definition}
\smallskip

Since the monomial order $\prec$ is fixed, me simply say monic instead of
$\prec$-monic. Given a set~$\Theta\subseteq\Weyl{n}$ of monic operators,
let us consider the rewriting relation $\rewTheta$ induced by the
following rewriting rules: 
\begin{equation}\label{equ:rewTheta}
  \RTheta:=\Big\{\partial^\alpha\lm(\D)\to_{\RTheta}\partial^\alpha
  r(\D):\ \D\in\Theta,\ \partial^\alpha\in\Mon(\Delta)\Big\}.
\end{equation}
For simplicity, we write $\D\rewTheta\D'$ instead of
$\D\to_{R_\Theta}\D'$. The rewriting relation $\rewTheta$ is terminating
since the rewriting rules reduce a monomial into a combination of
strictly smaller monomials w.r.t.\ the well-founded order $\prec$.
Moreover, notice that in that the case where the coefficient
$\lc(\D)\in\QXX$ of $\lm(\D)$ in $\D$ is not constant, the situation is
much harder. Indeed, in this case, the left-hand sides of the rewriting
rules are of the form $\partial^\alpha(\lc(\D)\lm(\D))$ and due to
commutation laws, these elements are not monomials. In particular, we are
not in the situation of our general approach developped in 
Section~\ref{sec:a_weak_version_of_the_Diamond_Lemma} anymore.
\medskip

We finish this section with some comments on $\rewTheta$. Let us consider 
the linear system of ordinary differential or partial derivative
equations given by 
\begin{equation}\label{equ:PDE_system}
  \{(\D y)=0:\D\in\Theta\}.
\end{equation}
Let $y(x)$ be an arbitrary solution of this system. Then, for every
operator $\partial^\alpha$ and every $\D\in\Theta$, we also have
$(\partial^\alpha\D y)(x)=0$, or equivalently,
$(\partial^\alpha\lm(\D)y)(x)=(\partial^\alpha r(\D)y)(x)$. Hence, if
there is a rewriting path $\D_1\transTheta\D_2$, then the solution $y(x)$
of~\eqref{equ:PDE_system} satisfies $(\D_1y)(x)=(\D_2y)(x)$. This remark
has deep applications in the formal theory of partial differential
equations, for instance for finding integrability conditions or computing
dimensions of solution spaces, see~\cite{MR1308976}. Moreover, notice
that since $\monBasis$ is a commutative set, there is another possible
choice for rewriting the monomial $\partial^\alpha\lm(\D)$
in~\eqref{equ:rewTheta}. Indeed, we could swap $\partial^\alpha$ and
$\lm(\D)$ to get the new rule
$\lm(\D)\partial^\alpha\rewTheta r(\D)\partial^\alpha$. This rule is
simpler in the sense that it does not require to apply any commutation 
law to its right-hand side in contrast with~\eqref{equ:rewTheta}.
However, we do not take this rule into account since it would break the
algebraic model of partial derivative equations. Indeed, if $y(x)$ is a
solution of~\eqref{equ:PDE_system}, then the relation
$(\lm(\D_i)\partial^\alpha y)(x)=(r(\D_i)\partial^\alpha y)(x)$ does not
hold in general, as illustrated in~\ref{it:ODE_rew} of the following
example.
\smallskip

\begin{example}\label{ex:diff_operators_rew}
  We continue Example~\ref{ex:diff_operators_init}.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item\label{it:ODE_rew} Let $\Theta:=\{\D\}$ where
    $\D:=\partial-x\in\Weyl{1}$. Since $\partial$ is greater than $1$ for
    every monomial order, $\rewTheta$ is induced by the rewriting rules
    $\partial^n\rewTheta \partial^{n-1}x$, where $n$ is a strictly
    postive integer. In particular, we have the following rewriting
    sequence:
    \[\partial^2\rewTheta\partial x=x\partial+1\rewTheta x^2+1.
    \smallskip\]
    In terms of the corresponding differential equation $y'(x)=xy(x)$,
    this rewriting sequence has the following meaning. First, notice that
    the space of solutions of this equation is the one-dimensional
    $\R$-vector space spanned by the function $e^{x^2/2}$. The second
    order derivative of a generic solution $y(x)=Ce^{x^2/2}$, for an
    arbitrary constant $C$, is given by $y''(x)=(x^2+1)Ce^{x^2/2}$, which
    reads  $(\partial^2y)(x)=(x^2+1)y(x)$ in terms of operators. Notice
    that if we allow to reduce the left $\partial$ in $\partial^2$, then
    we get $\partial^2\transTheta x^2$, which is false in terms of
    operators since $y''(x)$ is not equal to $x^2y(x)$. 
  \item\label{it:Janet_example_rew} Let $\Theta:=\{\D_1,\D_2\}$, where
    $\D_1:=\partial_3^2-x_2\partial_1^2$ and $\D_2:=\partial_2^2$
    correspond to the two equations of the Janet example. We define
    $\prec$ as being the deg-lex order on
    $\Mon(\partial_1,\partial_2,\partial_3)$ induced by
    $\partial_1\prec\partial_2\prec\partial_3$, so that $\rewTheta$ is
    induced by the rewriting rules
    $\partial_3^2\rewTheta x_2\partial_1^2$ and
    $\partial_2^2\rewTheta 0$. Then, $\rewTheta$ is not confluent since:
    \begin{equation}\label{equ:non_conf_Janet_ex}
      \begin{tikzcd}
        \partial_2^2\partial_3^2\ar[d, "_\Theta"']\ar[r, "_\Theta"'] &
        \partial_2^2(x_2\partial_1^2)\ar[d, "_\Theta"]\\
        0 & 2\partial_1^2\partial_2
      \end{tikzcd}
    \end{equation}
    The right arrow is to the relation $\partial_2^2(x_2\partial_1^2)=2
    \partial_1^2\partial_2+\partial_1^2\partial_2^2$, which is proven
    applying twice the commutation law $\partial_2x_2=x_2\partial_2+1$.
    We deduce from~\eqref{equ:non_conf_Janet_ex} that any solution $y(x)$
    of the equations $(\D_iy)(x)=0$ has to verify the new integrability
    condition $y_{112}(x)=0$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{example}
\smallskip

\subsection{Involutive divisions and strategies}
\label{sec:involutive_divisions_ and_strategies}

In this section, we interpret involutive divisions in terms of strategies
for the rewriting relation induced by a set of monic differential
operators. From this, we show that the rewriting system induced by an
involutive set of operators is confluent.
\medskip

We first recall the definition of involutive division and associated
notions that are involutive divisors, multiplicative variables, and
autoreducibility. For that, we temporally work with monomials instead of
operators and denote these monomials with Latin letters $u,m$ instead
of~$\partial^\alpha$. Then, we will reuse the  operator notation for
monomials when we will consider rewriting systems on rational Weyl
algebras. An {\em involutive division} $L$ on $\Mon(\Delta)$ is defined
by a binary relation $\divInv{L}^U$ on $U\times\Mon(\Delta)$, for every
finite subset $U\subset\Mon(\Delta)$, satisfying for every $u,u'\in U$
and every $m,m'\in\Mon(\Delta)$, the following relations:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
\item\label{it:div} $u\divInv{L}^Um\Rightarrow u\mid m$,
\item\label{it:unit} $u\divInv{L}^Uu$,
\item\label{it:mul} $u\divInv{L}^Uum$ and $u\divInv{L}^Uum'$ if and only
  if $u\divInv{L}^Uumm'$,
\item\label{it:vertex} $u\divInv{L}^Um$ and $u'\divInv{L}^Um$ implies
  $u\divInv{L}^Uu'$ or $u'\divInv{L}^Uu$,
\item\label{it:transitivity} $u\divInv{L}^Uu'$ and $u'\divInv{L}^Um$
  implies $u\divInv{L}^Um$,
\item\label{it:filter} for every $V\subseteq U$ and every $v\in V$,
  $v\divInv{L}^Um$ implies $v\divInv{L}^Vm$. 
\end{enumerate}
In the sequel, we write $\divInv{L}$ instead if $\divInv{L}^U$ when the
context is clear. We say that $u\in U$ is an {\em L-involutive divisor}
of a monomial $m$ if $u\divInv{L}m$. The variable~$\partial_i$ is said to be
{\em L-multiplicative} for $u$ w.r.t.\ $U$ if $u$ is an $L$-involutive
divisor of $\partial_iu$. Notice that $u\divInv{L}m$ if and only if
$m=m'u$, where $m'$ contains only $L$-multiplicative variables for $u$
w.r.t.\ $U$. Notice also that an involutive division is entirely
determined by the list of multiplicative variables w.r.t.\ each finite
set $U$ such that conditions \ref{it:vertex}, \ref{it:transitivity}, and
\ref{it:filter} are fulfilled. We say that $U$ is {\em L-autoreduced} if
every $u\in U$ admits only $u$ as $L$-involutive divisor, \ie,
$u\divInv{L}u'$ implies $u=u'$. Notice that if $U$ is $L$-autoreduced,
then every monomial $m$ admits at most one $L$-involutive divisor. 
\smallskip

\begin{example}
  Thomas, Janet, Pommaret
\end{example}
\smallskip

Now, we return to differential operators and we fix a monomial order
$\prec$ on $\monBasis$. Given a finite set $\Theta\subset\Weyl{n}$ of
differential operators, all the theory of monomial sets can be applied to
the case where $U$ is the set 
\[\lm(\Theta):=\left\{\lm(\D):\ \D\in\Theta\right\}\subset\monBasis
\smallskip\]
of leading monomials of elements of $\Theta$. Hence, we may extend the
autoreducibility property for monomial sets w.r.t.\ an involutive
division to sets of differential operators. 
\smallskip

\begin{definition}
  Let $\Theta\subset\Weyl{n}$ be a finite set of differential operators,
  let $\prec$ be a monomial order, and let $L$ be an involutive division
  on $\Mon(\Delta)$. We say that $\Theta$ is {\em left L-autoreduced} if
  $\lm(\Theta)$ is $L$-autoreduced,
  respectively.
\end{definition}
\smallskip
\noindent
The adjective "left" is here to emphasis that it may exist
$\D,\D'\in\Theta$ such that $\lm(\D)$ is an $L$-involutive divisor of a
monomial $\partial^\alpha\in\supp(r(\D'))$.
\medskip

From now on, we fix a set $\Theta$ of monic (the order being fixed, we
drop it in $\prec$-monic) differential operators. Let $\RTheta$  be the
set of rewriting rules of the form
$\partial^\alpha\lm(\D)\rewTheta\partial^\alpha r(\D)$, such as
in~\eqref{equ:rewTheta}. Since $\lm(\Theta)$ is the only monomial set we
will work with, we omit it in the symbol of the involutive division: we
write $\lm(\D)\divInv{L}\partial^\alpha\lm(\D)$ when $\partial^\alpha$
contains only $L$-multiplicative variables for $\lm(\D)$ w.r.t.\
$\lm(\Theta)$. Finally, we let
\begin{equation}\label{equ:S-strategy}
  \SThetaL:=\Big\{\partial^\alpha\lm(\D)\rewThetaS{L}\partial^\alpha
  r(\D):\ \D\in\Theta,\quad\lm(\D)\divInv{L}\partial^\alpha\lm(\D)\Big\}.
  \smallskip
\end{equation}
Here again, we choose to write
$\partial^\alpha\lm(\D)\rewThetaS{L}\partial^\alpha r(\D)$ instead of
$\partial^\alpha\lm(\D)\twoheadrightarrow_{\SThetaL}\partial^\alpha
r(\D_i)$ in order to simplify notations.
\smallskip

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:involutive_strategy}
  Let L be an involutive division on $\Mon(\Delta)$ such that $\Theta$ is
  left L-autoreduced. Then $\SThetaL$ is a strategy for $\RTheta$.  
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  If the set $\Theta$ is left $L$-autoreduced, then every monomial admits
  at most one $L$-involutive divisor. Moreover, every left-hand side
  $\partial^\alpha\lm(\D)$ of a rewriting rule of $\SThetaL$ is
  $L$-divisible by~$\lm(\D)$. Hence, left-hand sides of $\SThetaL$ are
  pairwise distinct, which means that $\SThetaL$ is a pre-strategy for
  $\RTheta$. Finally, this pre-strategy is terminating since $\rewTheta$
  is terminating, so that~$\SThetaL$ is a strategy.
\end{proof}
\smallskip

From Proposition~\ref{prop:involutive_strategy}, any involutive division
$L$ such that $\Theta$ is left $L$-autoreduced induces a strategy
$\SThetaL$ for $\RTheta$. Hence, we get a well-defined normalisation
operator $\SThetaL$ corresponding to this strategy.
\smallskip

\begin{definition}
  Let $\Theta\subset\Weyl{n}$ be a finite set of differential operators,
  let $\prec$ be a monomial order on $\monBasis$ such that each element
  of $\Theta$ is monic, and let $L$ be an involutive division on
  $\Mon(\Delta)$ such that $\Theta$ is left $L$-autoreduced. We say that
  $\Theta$ is {\em L-involutive} if for every $\D\in\Theta$ and every
  $\partial^\alpha\in\Mon(\Delta)$, we have
  $\SThetaLNF(\partial^\alpha\D)=0$. 
\end{definition}
\smallskip

We can now state the main theorem of this section, which asserts that the
rewriting relation induced by an $L$-involutive set of differential
operators is confluent.
\medskip

\begin{theorem}
  Let $\Theta\subset\Weyl{n}$ be a finite set of differential operators,
  let $\prec$ be a monomial order on $\monBasis$ such that each element
  of $\Theta$ is monic , and let L be an involutive division 
  on~$\monBasis$ such that $\Theta$ is left L-autoreduced and
  L-involutive. Then, the rewriting relation~$\rewTheta$ is confluent.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $\SThetaL$ be the strategy for $\RTheta$ defined such as
  in~\eqref{equ:S-strategy}. Since rewriting rules of $\RTheta$ are of
  the form $\partial^\alpha\lm(\D)\rewTheta\partial^\alpha R(\D)$, where
  $\D\in\Theta$ and $\partial^\alpha\in\monBasis$, the assumption that
  $\Theta$ is $L$-involutive means that $\rewTheta$ is
  $\SThetaL$-confluent. By Theorem~\ref{thm:S-confluence_criterion},
  $\rewTheta$ is confluent.
\end{proof}
\medskip

The end of this section aims to show that
axioms~\ref{it:div}--\ref{it:transitivity} in the definition of an
involutive division may be formulated in a purely rewriting language
using strategies. We fix a strategy~$S$ for $\rewTheta$. For every
$\D\in\Theta$, we say that $\lm(\D)$ {\em S-divides} the monomial
$\partial^\alpha\in\monBasis$ if $S$ contains a rewriting rule of the
form $\partial^\alpha\lm(\D)\rewS\partial^\alpha r(\D)$ and we say that
the variable $\partial_i\in\Delta$ is {\em S-multiplicative} for $\D$ if
$\partial_i$ is $S$-divisible by $\lm(\D)$. 
\smallskip

\begin{definition}
  A strategy $S$ for $\RTheta$ is said to be {\em involutive} if for
  every left-hand side $\partial^\alpha\lm(\D)$ of a rewriting rule in
  $S$, then $\partial^\alpha$ contains only $S$-multiplicatrice variables
  of $\D$.
\end{definition}
\smallskip

\begin{proposition}
  If the strategy $S$ is involutive, then the S-division satisfies
  axioms~\ref{it:div}--\ref{it:transitivity} of the definition of an
  involutive division. Moreover, if L is an involutve division on
  $\monBasis$ such that $\Theta$ is left L-autoreduced, then the
  $\SThetaL$-division is the restriction of L to $\lm(\Theta)$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Let us show the first assertion. Axioms~\ref{it:div}, \ref{it:vertex},
  and~\ref{it:transitivity} hold since $S$ is a strategy for $\RTheta$.
  Indeed, left-hand sides of $\RTheta$ are of the form
  $\partial^\alpha\lm(\D)$, hence~\ref{it:div}, and left-hand sides of
  elements of $S$ are pairwise distinct, hence~\ref{it:vertex}
  and~\ref{it:transitivity}. Moreover, axioms~\ref{it:unit}
  and~\ref{it:mul} hold by definition of an involutive strategy.

  Let us show the second assertion. By definition of the strategy
  $\SThetaL$ and of the $\SThetaL$-division, $\lm(\D)$ has the same set
  of multiplicative variables for $L$ and for the $\SThetaL$-division.
  Hence, a monomial $\partial^\alpha$ is $L$-divisible by $\lm(\D)$, with
  $\D\in\Theta$, if and only if it is $\SThetaL$-divisible by $\lm(\D)$.
  That proves the assertion.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Conclusion.} We introduced a sufficient condition,
based on deterministic reduction strategies, of confluence for
rewriting systems on vector spaces. As a particular case,
we recover the Diamond Lemma. This work maybe extended in particular
into two main directions. The first one consists in weakening our assumption
on the set $\K$ of coefficients, by allowing non invertible coefficients.
A second extension consists in characterising Janet bases in this framework,
with the objective to develop constructive methods in the analysis and formal
resolution of PDE's.
